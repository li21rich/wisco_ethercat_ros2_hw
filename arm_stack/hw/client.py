"""The API every procedure talks to. The sim backend and the ROS 2 client both
implement it, so `arm <stage>` runs the same code with or without --sim.

Modes (spec: Hardware assumptions):
  'P'  CSP: the drive closes the position loop; we send q target and a torque
       feedforward (0x60B2) of gravity + friction. Stiff and safe.
  'T'  CST: the host law tau = Kp(q_d - q) + Kd(qd_d - qd) + g(q) + f(qd) + tau_ff
       runs in the RT loop. Compliant; needed for gravity comp and teaching.
Switching is bumpless: T starts from the measured torque, P from the actual
position.
