## WiscoHumanoids Hardware Interface

Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zwNxs48vFlNf9jD_jDFN_XyyGplYSpis/view?usp=sharing

This repository contains the physical hardware configuration, PDO mapping, and ROS 2 launch files to bridge the RK3588's real-time EtherCAT master to the Jetson Thor's high-level AI policy. Its contents are solely to run a single servo as a test demo. Note that it is configured to run on 100Hz instead of the intended 1kHz since it was made on a device that did not have PREEMPT_RT patched.

RK3588: The software is split into hardware definitions (this repo) and mathematical control plugins (loaded dynamically).

```

### Quick Start Workflow

**1. Build**
Run this from the workspace root (`[DIRECTORY]/wisco_ws`) whenever you make changes
```bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

**2. Source the Environment**
Run this in any new terminal before executing ROS 2 commands.
```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source [DIRECTORY]/wisco_ws/install/setup.bash
```

**3. Launch**
Requires `sudo` to allow the EtherCAT driver to access the raw `/dev/EtherCAT0` network device.
```bash
# 1. Start the kernel module (make sure the slave is connected)
sudo systemctl start ethercat

# 2. Launch ros2_control and the hardware interface
sudo -E bash -c 'source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && source ~/Code/wisco_ws/install/setup.bash && ros2 launch wisco_ethercat_ros2_hw test_bench.launch.py'
```

Note that the test bench by default runs an example python script that sends torque commands to the motor to spin every couple seconds.

rviz2 is recommended to visualize the servo as it runs.

### Useful Debugging Command Examples

Open a second (sourced) terminal while the launch file is running to inspect the real-time loop:

* **List active ROS2 topics:** `ros2 topic list`
* **Stream live motor telemetry (pos/vel/effort):** `ros2 topic echo /joint_states`
* **Verify hardware loaded:** `ros2 control list_hardware_interfaces`
* **Verify controllers loaded:** `ros2 control list_controllers`
* **Command torque manually:** `ros2 topic pub /effort_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "{data: [0.5]}"`
